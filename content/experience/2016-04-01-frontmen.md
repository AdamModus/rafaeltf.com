Customer: Jumbo

Period: January 2020 – Current

Achievements:
- Built the frontend so that Jumbo could allow customers to request refunds via the Jumbo website.
- Implemented architectural changes within the organisation to allow other developers to use orchestration of components Jumbo-wide.

The long version:
Took a lead developer role, creating the jumbo refund experience for customers from scratch (previously all refund requests had to be made via a phone call to the call center). Set up the repo, the practices, helped set up the pipeline using github actions, unit tests, automated e2e testing and created the vast majority of the codebase. Worked with another developer (more focused on the backend) to integrate the newly built frontend (with Nuxt and Vue) with middleware backend (Nuxt services) and then the actual Jumbo backend.

Joined the frontend guild to help the organisation move further, trying to improve the dev and also the customer experience. Created a type of orchestrated components, a new layer on the organisations component library, to be used by all developers.

Methods, techniques, frameworks:
Javascript, HTML5, SASS, Git, JIRA, Node.js, Yarn, Cypress, GraphQL, Vue, Nuxt, Jest

Customer: Rabobank

Period: September 2016 – December 2019

Achievements:
- Rebuilt transaction overview (most used feature for regular customers), decreasing size, increasing performance and cutting pipeline time to roughly a third of the original length, while increasing testing coverage.
- Joined the central platform team that created solutions and supported all the 400+ devs in the 100+ teams of the organisation.
- Helped the organisation move from a multirepo to a monorepo setup, while maintaining full retro-compatibility.
- Helped migrate the tech stack as well, again maintaining full retro-compatibility.

The long version:
Joined a team focused on building the transaction timeline view on both app and website (built with AngularJS, tested with Protractor and Karma/Jasmine). Refactored the entire feature to improve code quality and implemented proper unit test standards. Re-implemented E2E test and mocking systems from scratch, decreasing the pipeline execution time to a third.

Moved to join the frontend platform team, which builds tools and standards for other teams to create and implement their features. Provided support for all 400+ frontend developers in 100+ teams in the organisation. Within this team, became part of the organisation-wide undertaking that helped the app go from 2 stars rating to 4.6 starts in iOS.

Worked on a POC for new technologies to be introduced in the company. It became the production Rabobank Android app, running on typescript Angular 5, Ionic 3 and using Redux for state management. All the while being fully retro-compatible with the AngularJS features, meaning it is running both Angular and AngularJS.

Due to its success, started moving the organisation towards a frontend monorepo, with a new app (for Android, iOS and browser). Using Ionic 4, Angular 7, NX and Lerna as main tech, being still fully retro-compatible with the old AngularJS features (allowing each separate team to migrate separately and at their pace without a big-bang migration). Participated in building a CI/CD pipeline to be used in the monorepo in the entire bank, moving towards deploying to production twice a day while still featuring emergency rollback and other safety systems. Worked to help ease the transition and help fix some specific bugs for all the Rabobank developers.

Implemented services and components used organisation-wide.

Participated in the organisation of an informal Meetup group at Rabobank which focuses on Frontend only topics.

Methods, techniques, frameworks:
Javascript/Typescript, HTML, CSS/SASS, Git, JIRA, Node, NPM/Yarn, Webpack, Protractor, Jasmine, Jest, WebdriverIO, Cypress, Jenkins.

Customer: Beate Uhse

Period: July 2016 – September 2016

Achievements:
- Refactored and improved website performance by 50%
- Created a testing pipeline

The long version:
Member of a small team focused on a short-term project to increase performance on the Beate Uhse and it’s other websites (Pabo, Christine le Duc, etc…). Researched the state of the website, it’s biggest drawbacks and provided solutions to fix it. Provided a packaging solution using webpack and ES6 module loading. Refactored Javascript code and updated several libraries and their communication APIs. Parallel a build pipeline was set up for which he primarily worked on the automated testing using Selenium and Nightwatch.

Customer: Nuon/Vattenfall

Period: April 2016 - June 2016

Achievements:
- Implemented a feature to allow home owners to adjust their energy consumption declarations

The long version:
Member of an AGILE team, as one of the frontend experts, delivering new features and fixing bugs to the new B2B portal, already deployed to production. Interaction was done using angular with redux controlling the state of the app, using well defined swagger contracts to communicate with the backend. The frontend server worked in Nodejs, with Gulp tasks and testing using karma and protractor. These test were both purely UX testing and E2E testing using functional behavioural-driven tests.

Methods, techniques, frameworks:
Javascript, Angular 1.5.5, HTML5, SASS, Git, JIRA, Node.js, Gulp, Karma, Protractor, Redux, Swagger. NPM, Grunt/Gulp, Bower.
